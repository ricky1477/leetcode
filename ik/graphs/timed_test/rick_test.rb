# Given A Graph Build A New One With Reversed Edges

# Given a strongly connected directed graph, build a new graph with the same number of nodes
#  but every edge reversed. This is also called transposing a graph.


# Example

# Input: Any node of this graph:
# Output: Any node of the new:


# Notes
# Input Parameters: Function has one argument pointing to a node of the given graph.
# Output: Return any node of the new graph.

# Constraints:

#     1 <= number of nodes <= 315
#     Value in any node will be a unique integer between 1 and number of nodes, inclusive.
#     No multiple edges (connecting any pair of nodes in one direction) or self loops 
#     (edges connecting a node with itself) in the input graph.
#     You are not allowed to modify the given graph. Return a newly built graph. 


# Custom Input

# Input Format: The first line of input contains two space separated integers n and m, denoting number 
# of nodes and number of edges in the input graph, respectively. Next m lines contain two space 
# separated integers each: fromNode and toNode, denoting that there is an edge from fromNode to toNode in G.

# For example, if n = 3, m = 3 and edges = [(1 -> 2), (2 -> 3), (3 -> 1)], then input would be:

# 3 3

# 1 2

# 2 3

# 3 1

# Output Format: There will be one line of output, containing a string "Wrong Answer!" OR "Correct Answer!",
#  depending on the evaluation of your solutionâ€™s output. For input n = 3, m = 3 and 
#  edges = [(1 -> 2), (2 -> 3), (3 -> 1)], if your solution is correct, output will be:
# Correct Answer!
